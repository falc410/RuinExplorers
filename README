Mostly functional. Still needs to be implemented:

- Better preview animation handling (draw at 60fps!)

- Undo Function
- More Documentation

RuinExplorers - MainEngine

Current Bugs:
- crashes when trying to do air-combo (reason is that the attack animation on keyframe 6 (attack 7) sets setanygoto 11, so the next time attack is pressed any animation should play frame 11. but in midair we are using the fly animation which does not have a frame 11)

Improvements planned for the future:

- Code cleanup & documentation
- Allow for Different Resolutions
